"Keep in mind that when you do amendments to move primary points around, the rate must be changed in CBS for the corresponding new paths.Otherwise, CBS reflects  max rates.It would also be helpful when a new contract is executed that the rate be put in CBS; otherwise, again CBS reflects max rates.It is important to get these rates in CBS as the forecasting model pulls all rate information from CBS.If CBS reflects max rates the revenues will be grossly over estimated.Thanks for your help!",Rates Changes

"Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri By Jason Leopold  07/13/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This article was originally published earlier Friday.)LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office said.If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power buying business.Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners said.""Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be forced to do it again by the summer,"" one commissioner said.""It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone.The state has made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds.""Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late Thursday.Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts, aides in his office said.Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use the least amount of power.Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides said.Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State  The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to generate $2.5 billion.However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the commissioners said.Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners said.Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure there is enough power to meet demand.Future rate increases to finance the contracts are likely, state officials have said.But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to be sold.The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since last year.After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down Monday.Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov.Gray Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the generators than what he thinks the state is owed.",Dow Jones--PUC to Raise Rates Another 25% to Cover DWR Contracts?

"Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.The company code is 179E.The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:   If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.No changes here.If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.These ""5"" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate ""5"" series cost center on company 179E.If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.",Message from Jim Saunders - Account Coding Changes for NNG

"Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.04/06/2001 Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday  it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its  broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously  described as an internal redeployment of staff.Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is  cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has  completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network  and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal  computers.""The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are  required for technical positions,"" she said.The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active  role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate  events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than  expected, she said.However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue  entertainment-on-demand services actively.Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for  redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron  units, although there could be some involuntary terminations.Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron  Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of  staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment  there.The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading  in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in  line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and  telecommunications stocks in particular.On Friday it was up 95 cents at  $56.65.Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband  communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth  marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and  electricity trading operation.Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's  success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and  other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last  year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index.Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform  strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter,  exceeding the total for all of 2000.Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to  fill some other positions.",Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

"Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE  and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by  Enron.I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run  will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to  move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect  their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing  sector).The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily  be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will  realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.It is not a bad model just a different one.Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall  Street.Regards",Assets and Trading

"CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.Specifically:   Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered accordingly.Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc.and SCE's TOU-8, etc.Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.(As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.)Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability.The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc.All bear upon such an effort.Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality.In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday.Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities.In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the following is observed.For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.Of the 163, all but 8 can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.The 8 would appear to require a field visit.For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or 3% of the total are SIC 20.Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly interval meters.The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming.Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a significant barrier to establishing the program.",Synopsis of (Ag) Food Processors Rate Design Proposal

"FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM:  1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase.Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues.GPU will probably be stalling most activity until a definitive answer is announced.The NJ BPU will determine its verdict on the merger Jun 29.2) PPL's (regulated) RFP is due tomorrow.Enron will not be quoting, given the fact that the size is HUGE.......46,260,000 PV'd MWH, ancillary and ICAP requirements.I believe PPL (unreg) will be quoting on a this, and are talking ot them about taking them out of some of the energy risk, leaving them more merchant MW.Also , the quotes are due tomorrow, but must be held open until July 16 (what a deal!).3) NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is looking to hold a joint competitive bid of energy and capacity to all default suppliers.This is expected to be 18,000MW, which includes the load of PSEG, GPU NJ, and Connectiv NJ.The BPU will be reviewing the proposals Aug 1.I will be out of the office Wed- Fri, seeing Exelon, GPU, PPL, and UGI.Janelle",quick PJM update

"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.",Management Changes

"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.",Change of Control Provisions

"Some thoughts that might help from time to time.This was forwarded to me,  and I found it very compelling.G   Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one  so  that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful  for that gift.When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often  times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has   been opened for us.The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a  porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it  was the best conversation you've ever had.It's true that we don't know what   we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've   been missing until it arrives.Giving someone all your love is never an  assurance that they'll love you back!Don't expect love in return; just wait   for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in  yours.It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone,  and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.Don't  go for looks; they can deceive.Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.Go  for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark   day seem bright.Find the one that makes your heart smile.There are moments   in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from  your dreams and hug them for real!Dream what you want to dream; go where  you  want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one  chance to do all the things you want to do.May you have enough happiness to   make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you  human, enough hope to make you happy.Always put yourself in others' shoes.If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too.The  happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just  make the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for  those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have  tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have  touched  their lives.Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a  tear.The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you  can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and  heartaches.When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was  smiling.Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling  and everyone around you is crying.Please send this message to those people  who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or   another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that  make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those  who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.And if  you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss  out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message.",Moving Thoughts (Words of Wisdom)

"I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across  something I hadn't noticed before.In EnPower, we have several choices for  the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically ""Mid-C Firm  Peak.""We have non-firm peak, and something called ""Mid-Columbia Index.""I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the  Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index.In this case, because I was entering a  round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different  deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak,  and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays.But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I  entered the first as Mid-C Index.Deal numbers are: 597244 - Peak 597245 - Off Peak 597246 - Sundays/Holidays  I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I  want to make sure that ""Mid-C Index"" gets the peak price.Could you let me  know if it doesn't?And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another  pub code set up for peak price.Thanks for your help on this.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,",Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Index

"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Named CFO

"Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law  bullets this morning.A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and  Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).LG&E's  gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into  Northern was approx.180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.Rockey  and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good  arguments for avoiding the liability.The unexpected (and unmetered)  deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance  during the referenced 3 month period.Accordingly, I assume the cost of  replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should  not affect earnings.I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this  matter.DF",LG&E issue

"The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.The pipes in question are:  -  National Fuel and Gas This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.-  TCO We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.-  CGT This is a ""sister"" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).And that's it!!TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!?;-)  As always, any questions, just ask.Thanks,",A light at the end of the tunnel?

I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to  6.423 (deal 205687).I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand  from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).We were billed 6.423 in January.That's  an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50.,Penn Fuel CGAS capacity

"Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air  Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1  C/S which occurred in 1996.Transwestern had met with the AQB over this  issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further  actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was  received.The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of  interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing  smaller turbine (3505).The larger internal components  (inlet guide  vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to  simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.When Transwestern received  permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity,  Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher  turbine value 4700.The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not  make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by  Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.Only Solar is  authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.This prevents Transwestern  from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this  turbine at their descretion.In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a  emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than  the permitted values for the 3505.It was shown that emissions from the 4700  were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.It should also be  mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple  cycle.Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to  be outstanding as determined by the EPA.Dave Nutt has been sent the  Compliance Order to review.Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern  has 30 days to request another hearing.Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and  handle this issue.Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a  conference call for sometime next week?","Compliance Order, P-1 C/S"

"As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the  assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a  local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in  Portand, Oregon.This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9,  2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures  which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the  environmental risks associated with each issue.A relative risk number  between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential  risk impact.A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with  this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an  issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.An approximate cost   value has also been assigned to each discipline.It is to be understood and  explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative  estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or  formally close each issue.Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact  and affect NWNG.The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is  based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG  personnel.Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of  information presented.General Pipeline Characteristics ;  This is a dry pipeline system.No pipeline liquids are generated, only small  volumes of compressor oils are collected.All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.There is still approx.100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage,  and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity).this is a non Title V major source.NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their  underground storage capacity.NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of  2002.All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the  agencies.Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.NWNG has  completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.Environmental Procedures Manual.The NWNG environmental procedures manual   appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.The topics  covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company  appeared to be involved with.The manual addressed waste management,  permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.There was also a written  statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to  enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG.Risk: 0  Cost: $0  Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).In a summary  page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against  the company was available.Although the company had received a few  notices  (<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small  recordkeeping and right of way issues.There were no outstanding judgements,  NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.Risk: 0  Cost: $0   PCBs.In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have  never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company,  the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.Risk:  1  Cost: $0          Mercury.Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and  not in natural gas metering equipment.A decision was made by environmental  management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.An investigation  has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers  or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment  which may have been used.Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000  Onsite Disposal.Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas  plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not  aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous  waste.Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined  Hazardous Waste.There is only one location where hazardous waste is  generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is  used.This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity  generator.The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous  waste.Risk: 0  Cost:  0   NORMS.The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually  occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline  system.Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does  NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.Risk:  1  Cost:  $500  Underground Storage Tanks (UST).There is only one regulated underground  storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in  complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and  recordkeeping.All other underground tanks have been removed.At one of the  tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.Closure  of this site is expected in the near future.Risk: 1  Cost: $500  LNG plants.In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no  histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural  gas (LNG)  plants.The exception to this is a historic site of a  manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.This  issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas  Plant.Risk: 0  Cost:  $0  Manufactured Gas Plants.NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured  gas plants (MGPs).Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had  operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.Eugene Water and Electrical Board.The City of Eugene has determined that  a  parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous  responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time  period of 1958-1976.The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is  the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean  the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has  indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.NWNG has offered to pay  compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all  liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City  of Eugene.The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB  has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately  $94,000.Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000   Salem Site.According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been  remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the    regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.NWNG has received  endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.Risk: 1   Cost: $0   Manufactured Gas Plant.This site, which ceased operation in the early  1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.From the time the facility ceased   operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail  bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial  watercourse in Oregon.There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river  sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds  of  London.The insurance policies were not available at the time of this  due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this  site.Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.The Environmetnal Protection Agency has  determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received  contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify  the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.This superfund site extends  for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites,  originally owned by NWNG.The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary  responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the  contamination of this section of the Willamette River.NWNG has been  identified as a contributing member to the contamination.Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of  water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland  Harbor Superfund Site.The Linnton facility, which originally included the  Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar  wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non   aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.Characteristically these  waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and  cyanide.During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were  originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in   1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.Preliminary  investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility  operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil  underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6  million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.It was also estimated from these  reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed  with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more  years.NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of  London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion  of this superfund responsibility.The policies were not availble during the  due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.Additionally,  because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the  subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not  been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be  evaluated.It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate  extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance  coverage  appears to be somewhat premature.Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000",Due Diligence Northwest Natural Gas Company-Summary

"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.This is still above investment grade.The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.We will continue to update you as new developments arise.Thank you.",Enron Update

"Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term.FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps  Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines.In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC.Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission.FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents.The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days.The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution.Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.",FERC Limits Access to Pipeline Maps

"This has been a tough couple of weeks.I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.Here's a rundown of events from last week:  We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.-The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.All agency ratings are investment grade.Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:  EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.Transaction counts remain higher than average.EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.And that's where you come in.Look around you.Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",Enron Update

"Stephanie and Frank: Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my  understanding of where things stand:  1.On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password  application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set  up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.My understanding is that he  will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those  accounts.Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?2.Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the  Transfer Agreement to become effective.Since we are changing the date from  June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and  their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.Once the new date is  picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but  nothing should be done until before then.Either Susan or I will let you  know when that date is.Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.Carol",Utilicorp

"David,  Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the  positions can be pulled into the benchmark.2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is  overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.If one of  your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books  your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.This  process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not  designed to handle.These files must then be loaded into GRMS.4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do  not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.The more  books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends  that book to the back of the GRMS que.This means that the entire process  must be started over.7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time  researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS  position.8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact  the GRMS support team.Since this usually occurs after their regular hours  it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone  with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently  in the bench.10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and  have to shut down.Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is  lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen  it.If you have any more questions let me know.Robin x57478",Benchmark Process

"Speak of the devil.Tino called, all full of optimism and questions.They  have pitched the DOE a deal in which Dennis builds three 50 Mw turbines on  the Isleta, and a 7 mile power line to DOE's distribution lines.The project  will apparently be 100%debt financed, with DOE agreeing to pay a firm demand  charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents/kwh.That rate is supposedly high  enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort.basis (remember, DOE can only  sign 10 year contracts).DOE is interested, says Tino, because of the  redundant, dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability, and because Dennis  and Tino pitched DOE on all the $$$$ DOE will make from the surplus power  sales.Dennis apparently pitched them a ""share the upside"" deal under which  DOE keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales.Tino showed DOE the July  spot prices at 4 Corners, which Tino said included many days over $200/Mwh  and they got all excited.DOE has done a similar share the upside deal at  one of its facilities in Calif.

"Hello Everyone,   Well, I looked around again for another inexpensive  ski trip for us to take this year.The path has seemed to lead the same  direction as it did last year.Lake Tahoe is by far the cheapest  package deal I can find.I have already spoken to most of you who went  last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and great  atmosphere.The dates for this adventure are leaving the evening of  January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd (Sun.).The vacation package is through Southwest Airlines  Vacations.We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.We will depart: Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.Leaving Lake Tahoe: Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.And you ask how much for all this  excitement?This can be all yours for 359.75 per person.This price is for two people per room.I will need to know who would like  to go no later than Wednesday  afternoon so I can set up reservations.These  trips are booking fast.We will be able to do like last year.I will  call in the reservations and then each individual person will be able to call  Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own credit card.The only  other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift tickets and roundtrip transfer  from the airport to the hotel and back.This cost is $30.I figure  we will discuss the lift ticket options.Some people may want to  Snowmobile a day or do something else.We will discuss these options  further after the trip is set.Hope to see everyone there.The snow is  looking good up there so far.They had 24"" on the mountain  yesterday.Mason is going.I just don't have his e-mail  address but he said to count him in.Scott Tichavsky",Ski Trip 2002

"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Named CFO

"Dr. Lay,  Sir, I am almost positive that all avenues have been pursued to get Enron out of the hole we are in.However, I wanted to inquire if a reverse stock split (perhaps a 12 to 1 or 15 to 1) was a possible option.My knoweledge in terms of Enron's debt and who we are indebted to is limited to what I have heard through the media, but as I see it, many creditors are at a great risk to lose billions of dollars.Would banks such as JP Morgan or Citigroup or others potentially affected such as Janus Funds or Lehman Brothers be willing to invest in equity rather than pump in more debt?From my understanding, we need an immediate $4 billion, and I think this may be a potential solution to get instant cash, and then we can turn our interests to building customer and investor confidence.I hope I am not wasting your time with this, but this is not the time for any of us involved with this company to remain silent.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,",Potential solution

Morgan Securities said.A veteran trader said, ""It is going to be a less-populous affair this year.The people that have to do their annual deals will still be there, but we have noticed that people are not traveling unless they have to.""The downturn in the economic cycle has hit the world's largest non-ferrous metals market hard.Years of volume growth have ended, prices have fallen to lows and shrinking revenues and commissions have pared many brokers' profits.MitsuiBussan has scaled back activities and no longer makes markets, ScotiaMocatta has left the floor and blue-blooded N.M.

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?Several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the Edison MOU.?A snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome.Procedural Scenarios   Assembly  The Assembly Appropriations Committee's plan to take up SB 78XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote.While the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Friday's draft bill, it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend.If the problematic ""Shaver Lake"" provisions are removed from the bill, Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill (although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition).If the Shaver Lake amendments remain, several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee.Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal, and the business community supports some recent amendments.This likely mitigates concerns from other pro-business Democrats.With or without the Shaver Lake provisions, Hertzberg should get at least 41 Democratic members (and probably a few more), but no more than 2 Republicans (if any) to vote Aye on the bill.Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass, and there are 50 Democrats in his caucus.If the vote is close, a personal plea from him and/or the Governor should enable him to get to 41.Senate  The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assembly's amendments.This is where the prognosticating gets difficult.Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB 78xx.Gov.Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal, but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed (due to a variety of factors), and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position.This would lead to one of four scenarios:  ?Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate, and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept. 15th,  ?Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition (this option is unlikely),  ?Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill (as it is passed by the Assembly) for a         vote in the full Senate with his support, ?Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg, but as part of the deal, he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments, and another vote in the Assembly - before a vote in the Senate.John Burton is considered one of the smartest, and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today, so it is problematic to guess his next move.Additionally, external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result.For instance, the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way (e.g.workers compensation benefits, drug courts, reapportionment).Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult.But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him, and given Burton's past actions, he may string them along, holding out for several days (maybe even until Sept. 14th) before he agrees to anything.Governor  Assuming the bill escapes the Senate (and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes) the Governor will almost certainly sign it, regardless of Edison's public position.The bill will go into effect 90 days after the Governor signs it.Consumer groups have vowed to undo any ""Edison bailout"" enacted into law by way of the ballot box.That could be either (1) an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB 78xx and replacing it with other provisions, or (2) a referendum to repeal SB 78xx, making it as if the bill was never passed at all.Initiative  Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General, it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary, and another 25 days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary.After either the 15 or 40 days, the Attorney General sends it to the proponents, the Senate, the Assembly, and the Secretary of State.The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date.That is the day upon which all calculations are made.The proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures.However, the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters.Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election, on March 5, 2002 (statewide primaries), and so, could not qualify until the statewide general election on November 5, 2002.However the window is tight for that election, as well, and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September 2001 to qualify for November 2002.The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative, but cannot amend it.So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot.An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election (419,260 signatures).The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers.It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly, but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights has been successful at placing pro-consumer initiatives on the ballot before, including Prop.9 in 1998, which sought to undo AB 1890 before the public understood its ramifications.Referendum  Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives, although a successful referendum was on the March 7, 2000 ballot.Prior to that, the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June 1982 primary election ballot.All four were defeated.Since 1912, there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot.Of the 50 attempts, 39 qualified for the ballot, 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect.The circulation calendar, verification, timing, and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives.For example, the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred.The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute, though.Political Dynamics  Notwithstanding the Governor's and Assembly Speaker's desire to enact an Edison rescue package, Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the driver's seat.In fact, as noted above, there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around.One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout.In fact, members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility, their reluctance fed by generators' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout.Currently, due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue, there are not 41 votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly.We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence, and the bill will pass the Assembly.As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly, the state Senate presents an even larger challenge.However, at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than 50 percent.",CALIFORNIA UPDATE - 9/4/2001

"Dear All,  Please test the Stage Release of PortCalc version 4.2.2s1 and let us know of the results.The executable is      /stage/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr          New Features:  Version 4.2.2s1  Changes Affecting All:  Index Option :  1)  When the delivery point is in the same region as the index,  and it does not have a basis associated with it, the deal is evaluated as a Forward Start deal type per Research's specification and user approval of Matthew Motley.2)  When the delivery point is in the same region as the index, but with a basis, the deal is evaluated as a Basis Option as the scenario where the delivery point is in a different region from the index.This is a change from last release.Changes Affecting East:  For East and all its mirrored portfolios, there will be no blending of volatilities.Monthly Options will use the Monthly Volatility, and Daily Options with Daily Volatility.The same is applied for Volatility Smile.Before that, we applied different rules to selective option deal types.Swaption Volatility Curve - PortCalc can now evaluate Swaption based on its own Swaption Volatility Curve instead of the one entered per deal.This feature can be selected on the PortCalc window.If Curve Volatility is used, it would be for ALL Swaption deals in that Post ID.Changes Affecting EES:  RETAILEAST portfolio evaluation is mirrored the same as EAST.Changes Affecting Renewable:  Delivery Point - PortCalc will now use the Delivery Point as the Delivery Point description instead of the Vintage Year, which Emission does.Changes Affecting Australia:  End of month will no longer be treated as a business day.Changes Affecting Power Risk IT:  Term Strip Tables Consolidation - combine all three term strip tables into one for ease of handling and potentially faster performance in the future.Please do not hesitate to ask if there is any questions.Thanks,   Norman.x36976.",Power PortCalc STAGE Release 11/14/2001 Version 4.2.2s1

"This is to confirm my understanding of the BTRC's resolutions on the presentations made on Centana, Applied Terravision and Bridgeline.Centana - The transaction was presented and no objections were raised.I plan to work with Chip Schneider of the RAC group to circulate the DASH and have it executed.I will also work with the commercial counterparty to finalize a transaction that is consistent with the terms presented in the DASH.Applied Terravision - The deal was discussed and all parties agreed that it made sense to sell the warrants prior to the anticipated closing of the AT and COG merger (expected 3/15) in order to insure that some profits accrue to the benefit of ENA's creditors.That being said, it was determined that it wasn't worth expending any political capital with the Bankruptcy court in order to obtain the expeditious treatment that would be required.Melanie Gray is scheduled to speak with John Frankini (sp?)of Milbank later today to determine whether this sale could be construed as an ordinary course disposition.If they jointly conclude that it can be, we will move forward with the sale of the warrants unless the buyer insists upon a court order.I expect to hear back from Melanie later today.Assuming that I get the green light, Jeff Bartlett and I will get the DASH circulated and work to complete the sale of the warrants.Bridgeline - We discussed the need to pay bonuses and give merit increases to the Bridgeline employees.Everyone seemed to be on-board provided that we made sure that the ENA seconded employees would not participate in any ENA retention plan but rather just be limited to the proposed Bridgeline bonuses and merit raises.Ray Bowen has already communicated with Robert Jones to make sure that the ENA/Bridgeline employees will not be double-dipping and therefore, my understanding is that we have the necessary approval to vote in favor of paying these amounts (a bonus schedule was provided at the meeting and retention was discussed as being 3.5% of current salaries).Please advise as soon as possible if you believe that I am in error on any of the foregoing points.Thanks",BTRC Meeting on Centana / Applied Terravision / Bridgeline

"Rick/Jim  1)  It has come to my attention that the relocation of employees to home countries is in jeopardy.Third hand, I understand that Prudential has refused to continue to pack, move and pay air fare to people seeking to move due to concern about clawback of payments made by the bankruptcy court.Many of those literally have no money.Is there any way to get the facts out to everyone and to address these issues?These are questions of legitimate expenses addressing basic human needs like food, clothing and shelter.2) I would suggest that we grab(pay)  in-house counsel here that understands the business (Paul Simons?)in lieu of paying Weil for what I percieve as little or no value added.3) As stated in yesterday's meeting, we will need to rely on EEL employees to do things like maintain books, provide settlements/invoices, accounting and banking among others.They either work for the administrator or have been let go by the administrator.Some provision to pay them needs to happen quickly.4) FYI - I spoke with David Messer, the head of Sempra Energy Trading, yesterday.David had been with Drexel during its bankruptcy.He said that all retained employees received an immediate 100% increase in pay (on the day of the filing) and did not intimate that such things as economy class airfares to repatriate employees needed to be reviewed by Congress.I realize that everyone is in some level of chaos, but based on what I read in the press, there are lots of decisions being made where the priorities - legally, morally, and ethically - appear to be in an improper order.Anything either of you can do to re-order such things would be appreciated.Ted",Repatriation

This is a rough era for American business icons.Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest.The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed.High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms.But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.",What Enron Did Right

"As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some  talking points for your use.Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new  capacity grew by only 2%.But, as you would expect, the market responded by  proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak  demand growth.The regulatory process, at both the state and local level,  has failed to site this new generation.The problem is regulation, not  deregulation.When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices,  Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego  customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current  summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).After publication of  Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.Again, the market responded  where regulation failed.San Diego has not accepted any of these offers  because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside  of the PX (i.e.the spot market).In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional  generation.Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time  for the summer of 1999.Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market  responds.The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition  not reregulation.Policy makers should:  Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it  is needed.Expedite interconnection of new generation.Expedite siting of new facilities.Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side  solutions.Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff  Dasovich of our San Francisco office.","Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California"

"Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com May 7, 2001  Higher Flyer  Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation measures.But they may still be good buys.By Michael Sivy  Value is a relative term.Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less.But that doesn't happen very often.Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent growth at a 16 P/E.Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with 18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s.The most successful growth stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio to those kinds of high flyers.For one thing, those companies are typically among the world's most successful.In addition, they receive ongoing support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts.As long as they continue to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market downturns.And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK].The Finnish giant is the most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company nearly double earnings per share since 1998.Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit growth.Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement business.And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the",Sivy on Stocks: Higher Flyer

Dividend payouts on SoCal common stock will be subject to CPUC approval during this extension.?100% of any revenue SoCal receives/generates from FERC/generator refunds will be applied to SoCal's debt.?Once SoCal's back debt has been recovered, any surplus revenue generated from the CPUC rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers.CPUC - DWR Rate Agreement The fact that the PUC voted down the DWR rate agreement (by a 4-1 margin) puts Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides in a very awkward position.This leaves Senator Burton's bill, SB 18XX, as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the General Fund.However, as late as this morning, Governor Davis vowed (through his spokesman) that SB 18XX was ""dead on arrival"" and would be vetoed.This move by the PUC puts pressure on Davis to sign SB 18XX in order to protect the bonds and the long-term power contacts he has negotiated.However, 18XX violates the terms of a number of the long-term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year.For example:   ?SB 18XX splits the revenue streams for payment of the General Fund's revenue bonds and payment to the DWR for power.It clarifies the funds that will go to repay the General Fund, but is much less clear on the funds to pay the DWR for power.SB 18XX leaves the long-term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do.?SB 18XX also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with Shearson Lehman earlier this year.The terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18XX is passed, the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state.These terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his DWR rate agreement rather than Burton's.Of course, this effort failed when the legislature easily passed SB 18XX.Today's PUC action further complicates the situation.While on the surface this would seem to force the governor's hand into signing SB 18XX, that may not, in fact, happen.It would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto SB 18XX, then force either the legislature or the PUC to ""play ball"" with him in order to repay the General Fund.Thus, another leverage point has been created.We will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of Davis signing or vetoing SB 18XX.",CALIFORNIA UPDATE - 10/02/2001

"Dear Ken, I apologize for bothering you with this kind of a nuisance, however I hope  you can help my friend.I called you a year ago about  problems dealing with the Houston Pipeline group.I am appealing to you again.I was contacted to provide nitrogen gas for a  pipeline pigging project last year on a 20"" line that goes south from Corpus  Christi.Rusty Bellflower told me I was  going to provide the nitrogen and then after my group was mobilized on short  notice over a weekend, they cancelled - did not even call us, just never called  back.I spent a week on the project and my subcontractor was out his  mobilization cost, and after more than a year, they finally paid a part of our  cost.During the negotiation for the nitrogen set up, I  visited the pipeline site, and saw some oil on the ground.I mentioned to the  HPL rep Rusty Bellflower, that I had a biological product that is excellent for  eliminating oil.He called in a big rush on a Friday afternoon and said for me  to hot shot 10 or so drums of the stuff to a site on the beach (10 pigs or  something) where they would put the chemical into the 20"" pipeline.He even gave  me a PO number (X000496) A week later he called and said they decided not to use  the chemical.I told him we were going to charge for restocking and the cost for  hot shot services.Rusty said that if we charged them anything we  could be sure that we would never work for HPL or Enron again.That is my experience with HPL.Now my friend Jay Pope with Coastline Resources is  also having trouble on his part of the pipeline work.Nick Cocavessis of HPL  contacted Jay and asked Jay to bid the pigging job.A few things went wrong, but  most of them were a result of bad decisions on the part of the HPL personnel.Why did they call a small outfit like Coastline in the first place?It looks  like they called them so they could muscle them around at the end of the job.Jay Pope has been able to reduce the balance due to the subcontractors to  $2,780,000.Enron is offering $2,550,000.Enron attorney (Andy  Edison) said ""Tell Jay he'll just have to chiselanother $ 230,000.00 out  of the sub's""   I am a stockholder in Enron, but I do not see the  sense in beating up contractors.Is there anything you can do to get the old HPL  group to settle with Jay?Thank you for looking at this.",Pipeline problem

"Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the  best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle.The problem was, Ford's  Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases,  was even more expensive.For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further  distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer.The result is a fine  SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content.This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210  horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies.Both engines come mated  to a five-speed automatic transmission.The new V8 offers copious and refined  power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers.Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing.Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its  ""New Edge"" theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps.Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a  distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone.Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however.An  all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame  design debuts this year.This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches -  thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance  to 9.2 inches.At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically  improved.The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits  flatter cornering characteristics.A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling  even more, while increasing interior room.Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002  Mountaineer.A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and  a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment,  although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does  intrude through the floor.New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power  adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front  seats and heated exterior mirrors.Among the Mountaineer's new safety  features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower  front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles.Later in  the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac  traction/stability control system will also be available.The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine  choices and improved rear suspension.There are plenty of SUVs on the market,  but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the  golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float  your boat.","Mountaineer vs. Explorer, per Edmunds.com"

"CKing@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Joe, Don,  As Joe indicated in his TIE response, voltage limits and voltage-collapse limits are studied off-line using detailed AC power-flow techniques.The resulting limits (in kV) are translated into a MW transfer limit  for the flowgates affected by the original voltage limit.To the extent that these surrogate limits reflect the expected voltage performance of the system, then SCUC/BME and SCD will secure the system accordingly.These rely on DC powerflow techniques, which by their nature are Blind to voltage problems.When this occurs, OOM is one tool that can be used to secure the system.When the realtime operation deviates from the conditions assumed in the analysis used to determine the voltage limits, the use of OOM and/or other measures may need to taken by the Operators to secure the system  I hope this clarifys the situation.Chuck",Voltage Limits

"Yan,  Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of  items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow  Summary sheet:  PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.The numbers in the Test Sheet  for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for  February 5th.I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's  website for the 5th.Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however,  sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.It appears the Test  Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.However, the  website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as  late as 7 am (we are not sure why).I understand you may pull the numbers  from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers  earlier.TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.We pull  the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.It  looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.They  differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the  other.To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.The numbers for February  6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.Is this a reporting or a  scrubbing problem?It is possible you are pulling the data from the website  before they update it with the next day's data.We manually type these  numbers in.If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would  not be in when this report is run.El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant  receipts.The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because  I don't think this is a cycle problem.General - The ""Difference"" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle  for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.This can cause  intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day  fluxuations.Any ""Difference"" column should compare identical cycles.I  suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day  and the previous day.This way we can compare identical cycles as well as  pick up any intraday fluxuations.As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.These notes should give us a great place to start.I look forward to getting  this report ready to use.Mat",West Desk Flow Summary Comments

"Greg,  I've been working with an IT guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for  some of us that can receive live prices from EOL.I've used this to build a  real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas  locations, including variable cost analysis, NPV, etc.I think that this  would be an extremely useful application to include on the EOL site, whether  it is in Excel format or some homemade format.For example, Hunter and I  were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk  components of their PBR.We brought up this idea and they were excited about  being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR  price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our  customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the  importance of using our site over our competitors.Let me know what you think!Fletch",EOL Idea

"KUDLOW'S TAKE by Lawrence Kudlow   DECLARING WAR ON RECESSION Why isn't the administration endorsing bold measures?October 1, 2001 8:00 a.m.   Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage war on the domestic recession.But Washington has no such plan.Respected policymakers look timid, cautious, and out of touch with the reality of a declining economy.Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing, seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms.The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly 60,000 to 450,000 - a nine-year high.This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump in unemployment is on the way.A just published and miserable durable-goods report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace.Over the three months ending in August, a composite high-tech index for shipments dropped 50.1% at an annual rate.Technology was the biggest contributor to the economic boom of the 1990s.Now it is the biggest drag.Even consumers are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chain-store sales are turning negative.Something has got to be done, but Washington isn't doing it.The Bush administration's economic officials have been ineffectual.There is no action-plan script, no talking points, no communication strategy.In short, there's no leadership on the domestic economic front.The administration is performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism.But thus far, it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic recession.If the domestic slump is left unattended, the nation will eventually become demoralized.Without economic vitality at home, it will be all the more difficult to maintain our edge overseas.Rising unemployment drains the spirit, but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies.The economy needs a jolt.It needs risk-taking.But policymakers seem unwilling to take risks.Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan - who keep telling us that too much stimulus will cause inflation - are providing more status-quo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions.Mr. Rubin's arguments about budget surpluses and long-term bond rates are red herrings at best.Actually, as the recession-driven federal budget moves into deficit, Treasury market interest rates are dropping to 40-year lows, undercutting Rubin's entire argument on the need to maintain budget surpluses at any economic cost.He has never understood that growth produces surpluses, rather than the other way around.The former Clinton Treasury man tells us that demand-side consumer tax rebates are okay while supply-side tax cuts on successful high-end earners and capital investments are not.Go figure.This is not economic analysis.It's a plain vanilla, liberal-redistribution agenda.Mr. Greenspan, meanwhile, says that capital-gains tax cuts are not the best way to deal with the economy's short-term problem.Yet it is exactly the deflation of capital asset values through the stock-market decline and the deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards for capital investment.Instead of pompous proclamations, let's do an historical scrub of the after-effects of cap-gains relief.If we do, it will show that faster economic growth, rising stock markets, and stronger budget revenues always follow lower tax-rates on capital investment.Jack Kemp and Sen. Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial proposal to slash cap gains, accelerate the depreciation of investment in plant, equipment, and technology, and make the phased-in personal tax-rate reductions effective immediately.Their monetary view that the Federal Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency cash injections is also correct.So, why aren't administration economists endorsing these bold measures?Why aren't they making the case that it's business that creates jobs, and that business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion?No amount of consumer tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capital-starved and profit-losing businesses don't get immediate relief from a permanent reduction of tax-rates.Bush policymakers should also make the case that the twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of roughly 1.5% of GDP ($150 billion) to finance tax-cuts, defense, and infrastructure-rebuilding policies that are necessary to re-ignite economic growth.The public is four-square behind the president in the global war against terrorism.It will also stand four-square behind the president in the war against recession.Indeed, the public knows that a strong domestic economy is vital to the war effort.Since President Bush's spectacular speech rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism, the Dow Jones stock index has appreciated 7%, or roughly 600 points.If the president rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession, the market will rise exponentially, signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American spirit.","KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online Financial -- October 1,  2001"

"Ken,  I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent events.It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past three and a half years.The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a personal inspiration to me.Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a real treat.Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.It is difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers of amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.I have the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image.I wouldn't ever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are experiencing.So I apologize if that does come to pass.One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses I've observed with EES' origination management.There is a general feeling  of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept  of an ""open door"" is political suicide.H.R.is as much at fault in my  opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective  view and judgement of the abuses.My words and credibility may not carry  any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination  that is all too common at EES.Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees  (and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company and am proud to have been a part of Enron.The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this past spring.Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career opportunities are limited.And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to move on.Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult  time.I wish that I could have done more.If I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.Thank you again.Respectfully,",thank you

"As you are aware, the legal group has been considering EPMI's options given  TVA's failure during the summer of 99 to treat Enron's control areas in a  manner similiar to other control areas.One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary  damages against TVA  for TVA's breach of NERC policies.In order to make  such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC  policies are a ""contract"" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by  and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.One  concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could  possibly be damaged in other, unrelated  proceedings if it was determined  that NERC policies were indeed ""contractual obligations"" (e.g., a third party  claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC  ""contractual policies"").It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me  with any thoughts or comments you have.Thanks for your help.",TVA Control Areas - NERC Policies

Britt Whitman at ex:5-4014 or Kristin Walsh at ex:3-9510.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate ?SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy   California Senate & SoCal's Fate  With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:  ?Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.?The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.?A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.   ?There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.?The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.?Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR.(Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov.Davis' request.All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are ""optimistic"" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning.Inside Edison  There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.)and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy.We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition.",California Update 9-14-2001

Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling.Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.Good news is that at  MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.The third round  of sampling taken at this location is not available.All other samples  collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to  be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.Line 311 is a 12 in.line which travels  north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.Previous testing  showed non detect.Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.Second sample has  been collected but results are not available.Samples are proposed to be  collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.There is a potential for the IMC Plant  to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is  considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.The  gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas  Co.  system which is PCB free.3.Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency.West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.The east end of the system  has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.Sampling frequency for these  locations is once every two weeks.When a sampling location is shown  to  have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the  sampling program.Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs  under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the  pipeline system.At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the  bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.By  increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the  separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter  separators.These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.The  determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1)  a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of  the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station)  have been added to the list of Priority sites.Flow through at the Kern  River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.Samples collected at this location have  shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this  location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.PG&E has indicated that  there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume  of gas deliveries.PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional  filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer  load at these locations.Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection  at these sites.PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express  additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.a. Siting, Design and Engineering   b.Cost Estimates   PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus  an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next  week..Four of these separators have been installed.A total of 45 filter  separators may be proposed for installation.The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29  indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.The sampling costs have  not been included in this number.Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites  basis as PG&E presented.One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions  of their plant that has PCB's.PG&E is in discussions with the cement  company.PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the  success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the  cement plant prior to committing to any action.If the deconning occurs, it  will be a 2001 project.6.Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.Compressor Oil Control.The majority of liquids collected at strategic  sampling locations is compressor oils.Transwestern has requested access to  the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.There are 22 compressors at the  Topock and Hinkley C/S's.Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies  to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.Earl will  coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.7.Other Issues or Concerns.Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January,  2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to  Transwestern.PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300  mmscf/day cap by May 15.Over time PG&E will look into their C/S  configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.8.Next Steps.The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.This time period will allow  inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection    additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.The location  of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as  some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on  other business.",May PCB Meeting Notes ET&S and PG&E

"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.",Management Changes

"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.",Change of Control Provisions

"On Friday (October 19), DWR released a revised revenue requirement.The result was to lower the Customer Revenue Requirement by$2.4 billion from the revenue requirement submitted on August 7th.The stated reasons for the change are:  1.Reduction in Gas Prices.For example, the August estimate included a fourth quarter 2001 gas price forecast of $7.68 at the Southern California border.In the recent submittal, this was reduced to $3.54.2.Change in Load because of Direct Access.As a result of the Commission delaying the suspension date from July 1 to September 20th there was a significant bump up in DA load, thus reducing the load fo which DWR must buy.For example, the August submittal contained an estimate of 448 GWh in the fourth quarter 2001 for direct access load.The October 19th submittal factored in a direct access load of 6,571 Gwh for fourth quarter 2001.3.Changes in Forecast due to DSM.DWR has decided not to engage in any demand side and demand bidding programs and has deferred decision on whether to reinstitute the 20/20 program next summer.The result of these decisions was a decrease of $513 million in the revenue requirement, while also increasing the load that DWR must buy for by 1896 Gwhs.4.Changes to Contracted for Power.An additional 156 MW (which is expected to be available to meet summer 2002 peak) has been contracted for since the August 7th submittal.5.Adjustments to the calculations of ancillary services costs.6.Changes in Debt Dervices Costs.For example, on October 11 (the day after the Commission rejected the rate agreement), the interest rate on the interim financing went up from .75% to  2.75%.7.Changes in Receipt of Funds from UDCs.Until the rate agreement between the Commission and DWR is approved, the UDCs have been withholding on the remittance of DWR's share the revenue receive from the sales of the UDCs own volumes.If any one would like a copy of DWR's entire submittal, let me know.Jeanne Bennett",DWR Revenue Requirement

"Jeff -  Here is a first cut at valuing the Grant's non firm power from Priest Rapid and Wanapum hydro projects.We assumed a term from 1/1/02 - 10/31/05.We assumed a price curve of Mid Columbia (thus we have included no transmission costs).Enron also assumed a payment to Grant due on 1/1/02.The last important assumption is how to value any ""negative firm"" power (defined as a situation in which Grant's non firm power in one month is lower than the critical year monthly figure).In this situation we carried over the negative water volume to the next month and net is against positive volumes.The total value to nonfirm power using the above assumptions is approximately $68 million.If Grant is interested in a $15 million lump sum then Enron would assume a 22% stake in the non firm hydro stream.Briefly I would like to explain our methodology for valuing the hydro.We took the hydro raw data from Grant on the two projects and also used the critical year assumption.In addition we created a curve to reflect the impact of water to power prices (ie the greater the water volume the lower the power prices).We then ran a number of simulations to create a distribution that describes the range of output values.Jeff I look forward to speaking with you about this in more detail.You can reach me at 503-464-3810.As I mentioned I will be out this week from Tuesday to Friday.Stewart Rosman",Grant valuation of Nonfirm hydro

"Hello -   Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.Their hours  are:   Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m. Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m. Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m. Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.Thanks!Ana Schick   P.S.Please respond to this email so I know you have  received it.Thank you.",Kindergarten teacher gifts for Christmas

"Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys  As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!al!ity and value.In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality.Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty.Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without","Adv: Reduce outside counsel fees, increase in-house expertise"

"<<MF June 7th 2001.pdf>>  Good Thursday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!Over the last few weeks, the bond market has rallied (except for today), despite early indications that May was a relatively solid month for the consumer.If consumer spending remains strong, the US economy is likely to avoid a recession.With inflation under control, and the economy hopefully emerging from the slowdown over the next few quarters, it seems that financial assets, and in particular stocks, should perform well going forward.While there are some sub-sectors of the economy that are in a recession (such as manufacturing and the tech.sector), they too should start to respond to an improvement in the overall economy.Longer term, investors have a great opportunity to invest in stocks now.The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.70%.The 10-year note yield is 5.29%.The 5-year is trading at 4.84%.Spot crude oil is trading at $27.95 p/b.Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.77 p/mcf.AD Time:  New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.This rule greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during blackout periods.Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession of material, non-public information.The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.Please email us or call us for more information.Lehman Brothers' Research.","The Morning Market Call - Thursday June 7th, 2001."

"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.Ken Lay",Message from Ken Lay

"Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before  the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking  into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up  on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned  power plants).Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star  witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.Their job was to set up El Paso and  Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.Their  message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas  at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide  the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets  any questions on the topic.It's attached.Apologies, it's quick and dirty,  but it provides the basics.Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to  offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California  Legislature is peddling.Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the  California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis  when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of  the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.Best,",Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of  the Story

"I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the ""reregulation threat"" at  the next meeting.Below are some of my observations:  While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the  triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and  high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some  of the data).There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national  political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to ""big oil""  (which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and  Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing  to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant  characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque  reliance on the market).Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its  prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at  least on the electricity issue.We did some focus group testing recently in  Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego",Upcoming Advisory Council Meeting

"To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book.The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner.The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%.Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe.This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%.Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.",Capital Book

"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.Ken Lay",Message from Ken Lay

"A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to  discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual  reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit.2) developing an  agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed  to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G.3) Presentation of the  results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the  Rogas project.The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was  approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety  Division.There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by  application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of  3 piplines.This is the only agency approval received as yet.Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas  pipeline.Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available  for purchase.It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating  this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that  EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary  acreage for the Rogas project.This is a major plus for the project.The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in  Az.was received.Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the  contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not  valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.The Navajo  Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the  reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.A  contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12.The F-1  environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by  this friday.The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.A meeting  with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S  facilities on the reservation on 3/20.After the meeting, applications  should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a  week.Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the  application.During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to  remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each  location.This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days,  assuming no major issues result.One interesting issue that might develop is  that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.",weekly environmental activity report-Roswell Area

"The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared  yesterday.Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the  entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of  gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will  consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to  lower chances of a successful utility appeal).The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the  pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.They will  submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that  legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the  utilties' power purchase costs.This action has reportedly been the result  of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office,  the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the  decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs  credit worthy and solvent.As a result of those wires stories, the  utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is  currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).We're  working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in  California, to get more info and will report back.The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer  rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.Only FERC was demonized more.Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,   made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next  meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the  utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue.And if an agreement is  reached, it could end up on the next agenda.",Brief Summary of Today's Activities in California (at Least Thus  Far)

"Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate  pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it  must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some  other basis.It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that  capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.However, I did not  find any case that stands for that exact proposition.As you may be aware,  the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up  with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory  basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to  its shippers.NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and  there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.The underlying  presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is  awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting  discriminatorily.But of course the Commission never comes out and says this  even though it should be obvious.Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA  (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim.basis?).Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers  of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the  capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we  will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to  participate in the auction process.Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the  effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the  Enrononline process.Now for some trivia.Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we  could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for  determining best bid?In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  ""The  Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season  provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid  evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing  different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different  transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology  before the bidding process begins.""The only problem is I am not sure we  have that ""flexibility"" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post  a different method.Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some  language allowing us to do so.I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what  you write I'd be happy to.",thoughts on Enrononline

"The CPUC published the SoCalGas unbundling order yesterday however due to Outlook problems I was unable to distribute it until today.Attached is a direct link to the order for your review.Since I'm using the website link to Outlook to send this e-mail, please let me know if you can't open the attachment and I will send it again when Outlook is back up in Omaha.The order is about 163 pages in length so if you don't have a good copier and want a hardcopy please give either myself or Blair a call and we will provide it for you.Significantly for Transwestern is the section on Intrastate Transmission Capacity and the Open Season process.This can be found on pages 41-58 with the Open Season discussion on pages 44 and 45.On pages 126 and 140, the commission directs SoCal to include an additional 375mm/d of backbone (including receipt point) capacity in the open season process.This is important because it includes the 50mm/d at Needles (per SoCal's exhibits in the system adequacy docket).In the Comprehensive Settlement, Appendix B, North Needles is listed as having capacity of 750mm/d of Primary Access Rights from Transwestern.It would be my recommendation that we need to encourage SoCal to revise this Appendix B as directed by the Commission to include the 50mm/d as capacity with Primary Access Rights from Transwestern as they had previously indicated in the Systems Adequacy Proceeding.SoCalGas was directed to file an Advice Letter to establish tariff revision to implement this order within 15 business  days of the effective date (December 11,2001).Assuming two holidays for Christmas and New Years Day, this would make their filing date January 3, 2002.If we all agree that we need to encourage SoCal to add the 50mm/d as part of the open season process, then this needs to be done prior to their Jan. 3rd filing.Steve/Lorraine, please let me know if I can be of assistance.Following their filing, interested parties have 20 days to file a protest and/or comments on an Advice Letter filing (January 23, 2002).Please review the order or pertinent portions and advise of any comments you may have for our response.I'll be in the office this week and on vacation between Christmas and New Years Day however I can be reached at home anytime.My home number is (402) 330-3860.  gh",SoCalGas Unbundling

"Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with  Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the  aborted IPO.His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months  ago.However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are  expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention  significant increases in gas and oil prices.Our current valuations, in the  $600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve  growth and current energy prices.Our current goal, is to be able to  demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and  reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a  significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.The  concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a  very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable  strategy to maximize the exit value).I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:  a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and  b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to  sell tha asset.I hope this meets with your approval.Regards",Mariner

"Folks, Here's some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina.Please correct me on any misunderstandings!ModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires.Documentation is available in Spanish only.All data input is by means of text files, which require column orientated input, ie numbers must go into specific columns.Detailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file.A weekly time step is used, with five load blocks per week, and a time horizon of one year, typically.Each model run requires about 6 hours of processing.ModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator.It is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence.CPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver, developed by ILOG.As the model is written in Fortran, the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available, so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level.We have no documentation describing how the model algorithms.Source code is not available at present.ModReg appears to model around 30 busses and 71 lines.Lines are characterised by from bus number, to bus number, maximum MW capacity in each direction, a percentage  loss factor, cost of transmission in each direction, and some other details.Demand data is specified by week and load block for each bus.Thermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified, with the possibility of multiple fuels.I understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere.From the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation: ModReg is difficult to use we do not know in detail what the model does we do not have documentation describing the algorithm  because source code is not available, we are completely dependent on the consultants.If Enron is to continue modeling Argentina, we should as a minimum have a model that we understand, is reasonably easy to use, and is documented.A graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use.Documentation is of course essential.We should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation.These steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results, and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model.SDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement.It would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations.The regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature, with zero impedance lines.Transmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows, so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values.Setting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job, that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models.Some direct cut and paste of data from one model's files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor.However the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention, GUI interface, and flexible output.Tom Halliburton",ModReg for Argentina

"September 5, 2001 Business World Crisis?What Crisis?By HOLMAN W. JENKINS, JR.The big news this summer is that Californians haven't been reduced to stone-age lifestyles, running naked in the streets and eating each other.The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter, when demand was not yet pumped up with air-conditioning.Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout.Gov.Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard, pulling 15,000 megawatts from his pointy hat.He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck, but obviously we underestimated him.Naah.California's summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winter's rolling blackouts were.Power there was aplenty (or at least enough to get by).What there wasn't was anybody to pay for it, thanks to the political system's paralysis as the state's private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on.We won't rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe, a ""deregulation"" plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity.A tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the state's taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody.Instead, the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money, accumulating $14 billion in unpayable IOUs to generators.Now, most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run 24 hours a day, supplying ""baseload"" power.But the majority of plants are part-timers, firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand.Revving up their turbines means incurring fuel, labor and maintenance costs, which means operators like to get paid.The crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts, each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid.In January, it was British Columbia Hydro, the big, government-owned operator of Canadian dams, which had kept California afloat on credit for months.In March it was dozens of small California generators, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they weren't getting paid by their utility customers.In July, it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West, making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge.Some shut down rather than take a chance, and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for California's mismanagement, the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada.There was no shortage, in other words, no ""energy crisis.""There was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities.We opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal.Yup.The state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell.In the teeth of peak air-conditioning season, electricity prices are now back to normal.In retrospect, what's amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state, but produced 62% more power than they had the year before to keep California lit.Yet they've gotten nothing but abuse from the governor, who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs.There is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems.But the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches.All they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with.",Crisis?

"When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on  another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074  (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream  pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas  transported on the upstream pipeline.The Commission recognized this as one  of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.Specifically,  the Commission stated:    The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has  acquired on an upstream  pipeline.Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the  gas on the upstream  pipeline.We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will  not, however, allow the pipeline  to hold title to the gas being shipped.Thus, the downstream pipeline will  be the shipper on the upstream  pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped.This results  in a limited exception to the rule  that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped.I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this  filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.You can feel  free to pass this along to your contact at PNM.",PNM filing: shipper must have title

"Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.Lorna       PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion  PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions.The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season.""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B.King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN.The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way.The new pipe became operational last Friday.GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine.Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest.Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California.GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003.The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service.The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system.Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d.""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said.In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma.The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said.""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready.""The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d.The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line.The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line.The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission.",PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Lliine in Service and Files for 2003  Expansion

"As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to  your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the  following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from  time to time).We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next  week.I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light  of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark  Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your  attention.One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every  financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.The Houston forms are currently located in a ""read-only"" directory.We need  to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they  use the form.Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use  creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms  evolve without  approval.Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is  when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap  agreement they approve.It counts as a form change, not a negotiation  change, if you make it in every agreement.Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily  accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical  component of the Fishkin Project).Thanks for your attention to this.",Form Revisions

"The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.Thanks.",Project Notre Dame - Change in Control

"Dear Ken,  I am a second year associate with RAC underwriting group.In the past few days, I have been watching fellow staff packing their personal items in an anticipation of a massive layoff while some have commence a lawsuit against the company (perhaps understandably).I believe that we all owe it to you the leaders and the company to offer ideas and suggestions on how best to handle the situation no matter how stupid such ideas may sound.The chance is that you have probably thought about and reject this idea, but I wonder how hopeless it will be to convince our creditors/debt holders to convert significant portion (if not all) of their debts holding to preferred equity (with option to convert to common).This no doubt will improve our credit rating, save us cash on interest payment, and give us room to borrow.Creditors can be offer a better conversion ratio which will be defensible even in the event of bankruptcy as long as they make some cash infusion at the same time.I know that banks generally do not like the idea of equity investment, but given the present situation, that might not be a bad idea as long as it is in attempt to safeguard their investments.I know it is a tough time and you have a lot of better things to do rather than reading emails, however, I will be pitching my ideas to you from time to time (as long as I'm around).I have absolute confidence in the ability of our leaders and I have no doubt that you all are doing your utmost best to improve the situation.Best Regards,",Just a suggestion
"Chip,  I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14.David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities.It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.David indicated, from his firm's preliminary review, that the potential negatives outweigh the possible advantages for the following reasons:  1)  Filing for bankruptcy may result in a claim by Texaco that the partnership agreement is an executory contract and that Texaco could reject any attempt by the Enron Partners to assume the contract.This would result in a deemed default by the Enron Partners under the Partnership Agreement notwithstanding the absence of any specific default language for a partner's bankruptcy; and   2)  The rights of Texaco to consent to any transfer of the Enron Partner's partnership interest would not, as previously thought, be invalidated by any bankruptcy.All of this may be moot as Brian Redmond has secured a preliminary agreement from Bridgeline to pay Dow directly (since they have the obligation to reimburse these amounts anyway).If that doesn't come to fruition, however, these findings will be important.Stuart",Bridgeline - Bankruptcy issues

"This has been a tough couple of weeks.I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.Here's a rundown of events from last week:  We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.-The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.All agency ratings are investment grade.Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:  EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.Transaction counts remain higher than average.EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.And that's where you come in.Look around you.Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",Enron Update

"Mr. Lay-  With all that is going on, a quick note to let you know that you still have an employee who is confident something good will prevail and not all may be lost.Though I have only been with the company for almost 2 years, I personally feel you are doing all you can to salvage what is possible.Your reputation precedes you and the many years you spent building this company up.I feel deep down that you wouldn't have done anything to jeapordize your name despite what the media and finance markets read.Responsibility is to be shared.Unfortunately, you have been left to do the clean up.I do believe in my heart of hearts that once Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow were in the positions they were, greed took over.Unfortunately, they took advantage of your position and possibly lost sight of dealings going on with the presumption that these men were of the utmost, outstanding character.Please view this email as simply a boost to your morale and not anything more than to simply advise you of what possibly many employees feel but have yet to convey.Thanks -",Vote of Confidence
"Jim: At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses  the termination issue.Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in  place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online  group.This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I  previously sent you, namely:  1.We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word ""may"" to ""shall"", due  in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.2.In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any  reference to omissions.I apologize for this.Please call me after you have had a chance to review  this.",ETA Amendment Letter

"Dear Shack,      I appreciate your standing up for me.Dent has always had it in for me ever since we threw his sorry naked ass into the fecal slime of Turtle Creek and then dumped him into the middle of the Gamma Phi house during chapter meeting.What really chapped him was that most of our pledge class was busy doing the same to Mitch Baddour and Rob Bugh.The only ones we could spare for Dent were Wilson Jones and Steve Larash.Even so, I think Steve stayed in the car and let Wilson take care of Dent by himself.I know Doug Dyer was in my pledge class, you morons.That allusion was an obscure literary device known as ""sarcasm"".If you're still confused,  I have a fraternity brother who is also a best-selling author.He might be able to explain it better (if he can get the creek shit out of his ears).",[smu-betas] Dent's wrath

"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.",Management Changes

"An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a  short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on  potential acquisitions.We have identified our target teams for due  diligence efforts around commodities.While each person on the list has  other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted  to projects as they arise.I will review this list continually and update it  as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent  job as part of a due diligence team.I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had  created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG  acquisition.We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this  checklist so that all are prepared.Let me know if you are interested in the  names on my list.Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence  effort.Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business  I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the  executive summary from the consulting team.I followed up with Brent Price  (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an  appropriate infrastructure to support that business.Currently, Todd Hall  and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.Todd has  other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time  that Todd would have.Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the  lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.She will be returning to  Houston from the London office by the end of March.She will be able to  split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.Todd will stay  involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.We will also  keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.Shelley is expected  to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week  regarding our plans.I will keep you posted.",Follow Up Items
"CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION  I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.Understanding that ""new"" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.The 3 choices I see are:  1..Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.2.Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.This would be a separate document.3.Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.Please let me know your thoughts asap.If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.Thanks.MDS",Extensions of CA Deals

"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).Thank you for your help in this matter.",Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues

"In response to my email of September 24 regarding the 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol, I received responses from only seven (7) institutions.No clear indication resulted from those seven responses (four in favor of proceeding with the Protocol; three in favor of working on a new Master Agreement with no Protocol).Before ISDA proceeds in either direction, it would be helpful to have wider market input.I should point out that ISDA intends to work on a new 2002 or 2003 Master Agreement; timing is the only issue - whether the process begins imminently or nine months from now.The benefits of proceeding with the Protocol is that it takes advantage of the considerable time and effort that has been invested in the initiative to date.While the rate of adherence may be diminished somewhat given the continuing skepticism over certain annexes, the Protocol remains a convenient and effective way for institutions to amend their Master Agreements.It also provides ISDA with some indication of the level of market interest in going forward with drafting a new Master Agreement and what provisions may be problematic.On the other hand, dissension has been expressed with respect to some of the Protocol's annexes, namely, the expansion of the Default under Specified Transactions, the involuntary insolvency provisions and the Replacement Value concept.In addition, there has been skepticism regarding the appropriateness of proceeding with the Protocol when the rate of adherence may not necessarily generate a new, widely-accepted standard for market practice.To a lesser degree, those firms that amend their Master Agreements via the Protocol may encounter certain issues when the new Master Agreement is ultimately produced.If you have not already contacted me with your response,  I would be grateful if you could let me know your institution's position as soon as possible.Thank you in advance.",SDR - 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol

"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan.This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",Answer

"Dynegy has requested a meeting with us to discuss what an ""Into Product"" is  and how this product works with what is currently going on with transmission  and how it may be impacted by future changes in transmission.Attendees from  Dynegy will include Griff Jones (Dynegy's head of trading), Matt (whose last  name I didn't get) and their lawyer Harlan Murphy.If you think somebody  else should attend or if you want them to come over here, let me know and I  can talk to Harlan.Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an  internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet  with Dynegy.As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively  with a large group of industry participants to define  what an Into Product  is.Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against  they way the product ultimately got defined.Dynegy put on a big dog and  pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that  EEI's Into product was flawed.Their position, while not completely  expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are  making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be  excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in  general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another  interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when  firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the  receiving control area).Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they  have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go  physical.At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in  firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent  product.Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:  1.Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition  - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.We  trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common  understanding of what we are trading.Critical to clear up this ambiguity.2.Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against  EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost  acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice  against the Into definition.3.Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what  will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is  such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally  we all agree how it should operate.Additionally, it is critical that we  start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in  transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may  want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes  into an RTO)  Call me with any questions/thoughts.Thanks","Meeting at Dynegy office on Sept 12th, 2:30 to 5:30"

Not with the previous ostentatiousness that prevailed in ""the old days"" but with  a newly developed sense of Wisdom and Maturity....And there will be articles in the Wall Street Journal about how the Enron giant  has slowly but consistently lifted itself out of the gutter to become a  ""Wiser & Quieter Enron"".If there is anything I can do to help you in this endeavor please let me know.I have no strong family obligations that prevent me from working long hours on some additional short-term projects to help out my Enron.Best Wishes!",I Am Happy!!!

"Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this.I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the ""without limitation"" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something ""set-off"" that fundamentally is not set-off.Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.Robert also makes the following points:  1.His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;  2.To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;  3.As drafting points, the ""without limitation"" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;  4.In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;  5.In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions:  1.We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;  2.We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;  3.We can leave the matter as is for all forms.(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.)Why don't you give me a call.I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.Peter.",Mandatory Set-Off Language

"Phillip,  I apologize that it has taken me so long to send you an e-mail like you asked us to, but I just wanted to send some suggestions/thoughts about things on the East Desk.1.I really like the idea of weekly meetings.Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.2.We were all going to give a small ""lesson"" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.That's it really.Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 ""merger"".I am really excited about our new group and I can't wait to move to the new building.Thanks,",Thoughts/Ideas

"Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will  better reflect my thinking around this investment.The current text suggests  that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in  the fund.I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in  the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.I would  suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:   It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an  effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant    investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is  important for the following reasons:   a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium  term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity  and capital transactions in the wholesale group;   b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and   c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral  benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor  and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.Regards",AIG Fund

"The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas  under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or  periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar  quarter.Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned  maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that  gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as ""maintenance,"" I'm  not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as  the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.I am also not  completely comfortable calling this ""force majeure"" because part of the  tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either  party; however, since the definition does include ""binding order of any court  or governmental authority,"" we could possibly say this is force majeure if  we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety  rule.(In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure  notice.)If not, we can argue that since this is not ""maintenance,"" but  simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner,  the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction  provisions.In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under  ordinary contract law.I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is  going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed  itself of the reservation charge reduction.I recommend we give shippers  reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate  plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.",tariff question

"Michelle,  As I indicated in my voice mail this morning, I am working with Janice Priddy, Manager of Enron Corporate Payroll, on a significant employment tax refund project.We are in the process of quantifying potential FICA, federal unemployment and state unemployment tax refunds related to both internal and external acquisitions involving employees.Essentially, if we are able to determine that the predecessor company had beneficial unemployment tax rates, we may be in a position to either retroactively or prospectively take advantage of those rates.In addition, mid-year transactions may also result in a refund of amounts paid by Enron in excess of certain federal and state wage bases (Enron may be entitled to take credit for those wages paid by the acquired company prior to, but during the same calendar year, as the transaction).We obtained Enron Corporate Data Sheets from Kate Cole and Deborah Korkmas was designated as a legal contact related to several external acquisitions.We have prepared a short, one page questionnaire, which will assist us in determining whether a significant refund opportunity exists related to these particular acquisitions.According to the Corporate Date Sheets, Deborah is the legal contact for the following acquisitions:  2000 - Garden State Paper Company, LLC (FEIN: 94-3371710) 2000 - KUCC Cleburne, LLC (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)  Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as much information as possible.If the acquisition did not involve employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer questions 1 and 2.In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.Thank you for your assistance in this process.If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.Once the questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com.Sincerely,",Employment Tax Refund Project

"Hi Steve and Bob, Happy New Year!!Steve, based on our meeting in Houston, I met with our engineering and operations folks to discuss the possibility of putting together a new firm (or limited firm) Park N Ride storage service on the pipeline project.Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.I think this was your greater concern.In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less?and for how long?Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.I will be out of the office on Friday 1/4 but look forward to hearing from you early next week.Best Regards,",Sun Devil Pipeline storage service

"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.Keep up the good work!Stan",Northern Natural Gas

"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.This is still above investment grade.The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.We will continue to update you as new developments arise.Thank you.",Enron Update

"Jeff-  As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.The purpose of this note is twofold.First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!","My Resignation, and a Question"
